This MATLAB script was written in 2014 by C. J. Ryu. It has the following novel
FDTD simulation features implemented based on the vector-potential formulation
of Maxwell's equations.

- Perfectly matched layers
- Plane-wave excitation
- Coupled Maxwell-Schrodinger system

The main script to run is [MAX_SCHROv4_3.m](MAX_SCHROv4_3.m).
